# Public Side Meeting: Consolidation
## Protocol development, the IETF and Internet consolidation
## Thursday, 28 July 1600-1730 local time

---

Several recent Internet drafts have discussed aspects of consolidation and how protocol design and consolidation interact. While some of the drafts have had extensive revisions based on discussions on mailing lists, consolidation is not a part of any charter for a Working Group and seldom gets discussed in larger, plenary sessions.  The purpose of this session is to have a brief discussion of some of the important contributions and then a discussion of whether this should be a topic that gets more formal treatment within some part of the IETF, IAB or IRTF. One of the drafts describes consolidation as "the process of increasing control over internet infrastructure and services by a small set of organizations.”
